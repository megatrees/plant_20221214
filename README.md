The megatrees GBOTB.extended.WP.tre, GBOTB.extended.LCVP.tre, GBOTB.extended.TPL.tre, and GBOTB.extended.WCVP.tre were generated based on megatrees reported in Jin and Qian (2022), Smith and Brown (2018), and Zanne et al. (2014). When any one of the megatrees is used to generate a phylogenetic tree, the following three publication should be cited:

Jin, Y. & Qian, H. (2022) V.PhyloMaker2: An updated and enlarged R package that can generate very large phylogenies for vascular plants. Plant Diversity, 44, 335-339.
